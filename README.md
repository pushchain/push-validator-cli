# Push Validator Manager

**Fast validator setup for Push Chain**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install & Start
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.push.network/node/install.sh | bash
```
Automatically installs and starts your validator using snapshot download (no full sync needed).

> **Note:** Restart terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to use `push-validator` from anywhere.

### Step 2: Verify Sync
```bash
push-validator status
```
Wait for: `✅ Catching Up: false` (snapshot download takes ~15-30 mins depending on connection, then block sync begins)

### Step 3: Register Validator
```bash
push-validator register-validator
```
**Requirements:** 2+ PC tokens from [faucet](https://faucet.push.org)

**Done! Your validator is running with automatic recovery enabled! 🎉**

## ⚠️ Temporary: RPC URL Configuration

> **Note:** This is a temporary requirement that will be removed in the next 2-3 weeks.

The validator currently requires external RPC URLs for cross-chain communication. To ensure seamless validator operation without chain halts, please configure the following:

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in your home directory (`~/`, where `~/.pchain` is also located):
   ```bash
   touch ~/.env
   ```

2. Add the following RPC URL configurations to the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Solana RPC
   RPC_URL_SOLANA_ETWTRABZAYQ6IMFEYKOURU166VU2XQA1=<your-solana-rpc-url>

   # EVM Chain RPCs
   RPC_URL_EIP155_11155111=<your-sepolia-rpc-url>      # Ethereum Sepolia
   RPC_URL_EIP155_421614=<your-arbitrum-sepolia-url>   # Arbitrum Sepolia
   RPC_URL_EIP155_84532=<your-base-sepolia-url>        # Base Sepolia
   RPC_URL_EIP155_97=<your-bsc-testnet-url>            # BSC Testnet
   ```

> **Recommended:** Use reliable paid RPC providers (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode) for optimal performance and uptime.

## 📊 Dashboard

Monitor your validator in real-time with an interactive dashboard:

```bash
push-validator dashboard
```

**Features:**
- **Node Status** - Process state, RPC connectivity, resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- **Chain Sync** - Real-time block height, sync progress with ETA, network latency
- **Validator Metrics** - Bonding status, voting power, commission rate, accumulated rewards
- **Network Overview** - Connected peers, chain ID, active validators list
- **Live Logs** - Stream node activity with search and filtering
- **Auto-Refresh** - Updates every 2 seconds for real-time monitoring

The dashboard provides everything you need to monitor validator health and performance at a glance.

## 📖 Commands

### Core
```bash
push-validator start                # Start node with snapshot sync
push-validator stop                 # Stop node
push-validator status               # Check sync & validator status
push-validator dashboard            # Live interactive monitoring dashboard
push-validator register-validator   # Register as validator
push-validator logs                 # View logs
```

### Validator Operations
```bash
push-validator increase-stake       # Increase validator stake and voting power
push-validator unjail               # Restore jailed validator to active status
push-validator withdraw-rewards     # Withdraw validator rewards and commission
push-validator restake-rewards      # Auto-withdraw and restake all rewards to increase validator power
```

### Monitoring
```bash
push-validator sync            # Monitor sync progress
push-validator peers           # Show peer connections (from local RPC)
push-validator doctor          # Run diagnostic checks on validator setup
```

### Management
```bash
push-validator restart         # Restart node
push-validator validators      # List validators (supports --output json)
push-validator balance         # Check balance (defaults to validator key)
push-validator reset           # Reset chain data (keeps address book)
push-validator full-reset      # ⚠️ Complete reset (deletes ALL keys and data)
push-validator backup          # Backup config and validator state
push-validator update          # Update CLI to latest version
```

## ⚡ Features

- **Snapshot Download**: Fast sync (~15-30 mins, no full blockchain download required)
- **Interactive Logs**: Real-time log viewer with search and filtering
- **Smart Detection**: Monitors for sync stalls and network issues
- **Reliable Snapshots**: Uses trusted RPC nodes for recovery
- **Multiple Outputs**: JSON, YAML, or text format support

## 🔄 Automatic Upgrades (Cosmovisor)

Your validator uses [Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/tooling/cosmovisor) for seamless, zero-downtime upgrades.

### How It Works

1. **Governance Proposal** - Network votes on upgrade proposal specifying target block height
2. **Auto-Download** - When approved, Cosmovisor automatically downloads the new binary
3. **Checksum Verification** - Binary verified via SHA256 before use
4. **Seamless Switch** - At upgrade height, node stops, switches binary, and restarts automatically

**No manual intervention required** - your validator stays up-to-date automatically.

### Directory Structure

```
~/.pchain/cosmovisor/
├── genesis/bin/pchaind     # Initial binary
├── upgrades/               # Upgrade binaries (auto-populated)
│   └── {upgrade-name}/bin/pchaind
└── current -> genesis/     # Symlink to active version
```

### Commands

```bash
push-validator cosmovisor status    # Check versions & pending upgrades
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Sync Failures / App Mismatch Errors

If you encounter sync failures or app hash mismatch errors, reset and restart:

```bash
push-validator reset
push-validator start
```

This clears the chain data and downloads a fresh snapshot. Snapshot download takes approximately 15-30 minutes depending on your connection, after which block sync will begin automatically.

## 📊 Network

- **Chain**: `push_42101-1` (Testnet)
- **Min Stake**: 1.5 PC
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.push.org
- **Explorer**: https://donut.push.network


## 🔄 Updates

The CLI automatically checks for updates and notifies you:
- **Dashboard**: Shows notification in header when update available
- **CLI commands**: Shows notification after command completes

### Manual Update
```bash
push-validator update              # Update to latest version
push-validator update --check      # Check only, don't install
push-validator update --version v1.2.0  # Install specific version
```

Updates download pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases with checksum verification.

## 🔧 Advanced Setup (Optional)

### Setup NGINX with SSL
```bash
bash scripts/setup-nginx.sh yourdomain.com
```
**Creates:**
- `https://yourdomain.com` - Cosmos RPC endpoint
- `https://evm.yourdomain.com` - EVM RPC endpoint
- Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Rate limiting and security headers

**Requirements:**
- Domain pointing to your server IP
- Ports 80/443 open
- Ubuntu/Debian system

### Log Rotation
```bash
bash scripts/setup-log-rotation.sh
```
Configures daily rotation with 14-day retention and compression.
